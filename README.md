<h1>Bert Sentiment Analyzer</h1>

This is an implementation of the BERT Sentiment Analyzer Algorithm by Google.
The model has been trained on the IMDB database.
This implementation follows the udemy.com/course/natural-language-processing-with-bert


Personal additions not in the course mentioned above:
Packaging in Flask 
Exposing the app running on colab as a Flask web app directly using flask-ngrok

<b>If you do use the code here for any reason, please note that you will have to run the Bert Sentiment Analysis file in order to generate the model that is used in the BERT Flask file.</b>
